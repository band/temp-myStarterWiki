### Four general categories of network relationships (?)

  1. Transmission networks: Connection is something that flows (water,
  electricity, money, news ...). Connection can be broken like a
  physical pipe.
  
  2. Interaction networks: Connection is an event with a specific time
  (any perhaps place?) (send an email, have a meal, put on a show
  together, hand-off a document ...). Connection is explicit.
  
  3. Attribution networks: Connection is an expression of a
  relationship (we are friends, I trust you, she recognizes you ...)
  Visible only if you state it.
  
  4. Affiliation networks: Connection is belonging to a group or
  category (we attend the same school, things are in the same
  category, organizations connected by board members). Linked by
  correlation, similarity, or membership. Implicit.
  
Note: these type descriptions are a bit fuzzy, but the distinctions
seem to have some value.

### Graphs can be represented or built up from two tables.

  - Nodes table: list of nodes and their properties
  
  - Edges table: list of relations with "Edge Type" between two node types.
