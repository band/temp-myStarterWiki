178 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT
. . . . No matter how highly automated a mechanical device may be, however, it remains necessary for us at least to think the com mand that activates it. We could therefore say that the machine exercises control over our very minds.

Anyone who has trouble in accepting the reciprocality of the relationship between men and machines may observe the same principle in operation between machine and machine, where mentality is not involved. An example that comes readily to mind is that of a thermostat used to regulate the temperature in an artificially heated room. When the temperature goes below a certain predetermined point, the thermostat turns the heat on; when the temperature has risen to the desired degree, it cuts it off. The thermostat, if it had a brain, would doubtless consider itself to be masterminding the climate in the room. On the other hand, if the room could talk, it would probably claim that it was in control of the thermostat, which automatically responds to the room temperature.

Since we draw a mental and verbal distinction between the thermostat and the heating system and the air in the room, we are inclined to try to decide which controls which. But in fact the three are functioning as an integrated unit.

All right, you say, but it remains a fact that when men and machines are involved, men have wills and machines do not. Is it not an insult to the dignity of man to suggest that machines are not subordinate to him? This question, it seems to me, makes it necessary to ask just what human will is.

I can produce a robot in such a way that when its batteries are about to give out it will automatically seek a source of elec tricity-a socket or other outlet--and get them recharged. can, in other words, endow the robot with a hunger instinct and the ability to satisfy it. To all appearances, when this robot begins to run out of power, it moves of its own free will to an electric socket that can revitalize it. Yet in truth I, the designer, give the robot its appetite; it is who cause it to act as it acts.

The robot's relationship to me is like my relationship to the Buddha. I, like all other human beings, was created by the Buddha (by the Void). Every movement of my hands or feet, every blink of my eyelids, is the result of the Buddha's will. There is no way in which a human being's body or mind can separate itself even momentarily from the Buddha's laws. To express it differently, men are appearances brought into being by the Void. This is what Yuian Iwasawa meant when he said that "every single hair con tains the buddha-nature."

How is it with machines? Reason dictates that they too must be "appearances brought into being by the Void." Some may argue that this is not true: that machines are made by men. But if men are appearances created by the Void, then whatever men create must also be created by the Void. It must also partake of the buddha-nature, as do the rocks and trees around us. Specifi cally, since I myself was created by the Buddha, the machines and robots that design must also be created by the Buddha.

In sum, a human being made by the Buddha and endowed by the Buddha with a will necessarily imposes that will upon a machine created by the Buddha. The truth is that everything in the universe is identical with the mind of the Buddha. That which controls and that which is controlled are both manifestations of the buddha-nature. We must not consider that we ourselves are operating machines. What is happening is that the buddha-nature is operating the buddha-nature.
THE BUDDHA-NATURE IN THE ROBOT 179

From the Buddha's viewpoint, there is no master-slave rela tionship between human beings and machines. The two are fused together in an interlocking entity. Man achieves dignity not by subjugating his mechanical inventions, but by recognizing in ma chines and robots the same buddha-nature that pervades his own inner self. When he does that, he acquires the ability to design good machines and to operate them for good and proper purposes.  In this way harmony between human beings and machines is achieved.

How can this principle be applied to everyday human relationships?

Let us imagine a young businessman jostling his way home on a crowded commuter train during the evening rush hour. The office is still very much with him. "'What a grind!" he thinks.  "The boss was pretty happy with himself today, but how would he feel if he had to do all the dirty work? How would he like driving himself to the breaking point every day of the world for the paltry salary get?"

To the much-put-upon average employee, the man sitting at a desk all the time ordering other people around appears to have it very soft. All he has to do is open his mouth and people jump to do his bidding. He doesn't spend his time bowing and saying "Yes, sir-just as you say, sir.'

But this view fails to take into consideration the mental strain of being a manager or executive. No one who has never had a staff of people working under him can know just how difficult it is to get other people to do what is desired of them. The baseball manager sits in the dugout and barks out orders. Without mov ing, he can change pitchers, or send in a pinch hitter, or order the batter to bunt. On the surface he is the great man exercising power, doing nothing himself, just basking in the glory of a com manding general. But think of the responsibility he accepts. If he miscalculates, he loses the game and is held accountable for the loss. And it is not as though he himself were in a position to pitch a shutout or drive in the winning run.

Many is the business executive who at times wishes he could take the time to do job himself rather than depend on a sub ordinate. To manage people effectively, the executive must con stantly consider how each of his subordinates feels about his job, how he will react to a given order, how he can be used in such a way as to conserve the executive's own time and effort. The executive's work begins with the fact that he is surrounded by people different from himself, who do not always perform as he wishes them to.

180 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT

When we speak of executives and subordinates, we imply a su perior-inferior relationship, but this is only apparent. In reality, executive and subordinate can function only in a single organiza tion in which the executive is as much used by his helpers as they are by him.

I once served on a panel of judges for an idea contest. There were about sixty entries, and we spent an entire day going through them one by one. Afterward, one of the ideas that we had thrown out kept coming back to me; I couldn't escape the sus picion that we had acted too hastily in eliminating it. When I asked the people in charge of the contest what had happened to this entry, I found that it had in fact proved to be a great practical success.

To myself I thought ruefully that to judge is also to be judged. I had been evaluated by a splendid contest entry and had been found completely incompetent.


The above thoughts, inspired largely by my robots, gave me an an swer to the question that we must all confront sooner or later, which is to say the basic question of how we ought to lead our lives.

That which human beings most desire in this world is genuine salvation. How can we achieve it ? The solution is simple in the extreme: to be saved, we must save. All we need do is forget about saving ourselves and direct our attention to saving others.  If we do this thoroughly, earnestly, selflessly, there will come a day when we ourselves are saved. Buddha-nature will evoke bud dha-nature: that is the great principle that governs the workings of all nature.

I succeeded in finding out from robots the most important rule of all for living. Human beings, who have minds, are constantly being thrown off the track by complications. The picture is rarely clear. We are told that everything has the buddha-nature, and we try to act accordingly. But then we discover that someone we know has done something perfectly execrable, and we begin to doubt. "'How,' we ask ourselves, "could anybody who would do an evil thing like that have the Buddha inside him?"' We feel that our trust has been betrayed, and we resent the person even more than if we had never expected any better from him.  But robots are simpler than people. So are mountains and rivers and plants and animals and insects. If these less complicated creatures begin to cause us difficulty, we have no trouble seeing that the fundamental cause is our own failure to function in accordance with the principles of the universe. The machines, the mountains, the rivers, the plants, the animals, the insects all tell us that we, who are filled from head to toe with the buddha nature, have nevertheless not succeeded in being what we ought to be.

THE BUDDHA-NATURE IN THE ROBOT 181

When we forget to pay proper respect to the buddha-nature in the wind and the water, typhoons and floods inform us of our lapse and show us in no uncertain terms how we have not lived up to the buddha-nature within ourselves. When we forget the buddha-nature in automobiles and other machines we have cre ated, a warning comes to us in the form of accidents or pollu tion. What everything in the universe is constantly saying to us is that the way to perfect our own buddha-nature is to respect the buddha-nature in other things and other people.

Chapter 17
Accepting the Incomprehensible on Faith

Several years ago I remember going down to Yokosuka one day on some personal business. Halfway back, just after my train pulled out of Kawasaki, we came to sudden stop and didn't move for a quite some time.

After four or five minutes, the conductor came on the loud speaker and said, "Reports are that 800 student activists have invaded Shimbashi Station, up ahead of us, and fighting has broken out among them. We ask your patience for the time being.'  "Good heavens!" I thought, "800 of them, lambasting each other with staves and pipes!"

"What are we going to do with those kids?" sighed a woman near me. "Why do they always have to be killing each other?"  It was hot, and the passengers were visibly irritated. After an hour the train finally started up again, and fifteen minutes later we were passing through the aftermath of the carnage. So many rocks had been thrown that the platform at Shimbashi resembled a gravel road. The whole place was littered with helmets, and the police had gathered a small mountain of sticks and bamboo poles.  Bloodstained headbands and T-shirts were scattered in profusion.  183

"What makes them do it?" was the thought that haunted me.  It was better back in the days when they hated the universities and the professors. Now they were lashing out even more viru lently at each other-at their own flesh and blood, as it were. Stu dent violence, now more than ten years old, had already claimed a fearsome number of dead and wounded. Obviously it was still escalating.

Once they had all been comrades. Why was it that now one look at each other drove them to fratricide? Cooler heads had urged them to lay down their makeshift (though potentially le thal) weapons and fight on the ideological level. To which they had scoffed, "Trust those pigs? Don't be crazy! There's nothing to do but stamp them out completely."

As I stood in the train thinking about this reaction, I remem bered something I had read: 'He who has faith but no compre hension increases in ignorance. He who has comprehension but no faith increases in evil views. This is from the Sutra of the Great Decease, and the recollection of it at that moment was spine-tingling.

The members of the Zengakuren, the nationwide Marxist stu dent organization from which the now-warring factions all des cended, were suffering from a surfeit of comprehension without faith. By comprehension, mean the ability to analyze--the intel lectual capacity to differentiate and discern, down to the finest differences. Endowed with superior intelligence, these students had understanding of a sort, but, lacking faith, they had all too palpably 'increased in evil views.' Because of this, they were able now to do nothing but doubt, and their doubts had given rise to murderous rivalries and enmities among them. Why had they forgotten how to believe and learned only how to doubt?  Could it not be that we, their teachers, and particularly those of us who taught them the natural sciences, were largely respon sible for making them this way?

184 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT

When you think of it, the natural sciences, which scholars study and expound to students, begin with the spirit of doubt. It was not enough for Newton to know that God made the apple fall from the tree; he wanted to know if there were not some other reason comprehensible to men. The scientist starts with a suspi cious attitude. When experiment justifies his suspicion, he ac cepts it as proven truth. Something that has been proved can no longer be doubted. It is, by its very nature, scientific fact.


The scientific approach is extremely important. It is the scien tist's duty to doubt, to experiment, and to try to arrive at in disputable proofs. If we are not careful, however, the scientific attitude can lead to a dangerous result, which is a tendency to reject that which science has not proved. It is one thing to believe wholeheartedly in that which has been explained scientifically, but quite another to refuse to believe that which science has not been able to explain.

Indeed, the very essence of faith is to believe in that which has not been explained and may never be explained. To have faith is to say to yourself, "I haven't proved this I don't know exactly what it consists of or how it works or what result it will lead to-but I believe it.' Faith is not needed to accept what has been proved intellectually. It is what we know intuitively to be true that must be accepted on faith. By the very act of believing, we acknowledge that what we believe may be genuine or false, right or wrong, truth or fiction, but that we are determined to believe it anyway.

Admittedly, there is a danger in this attitude, too. To hold stubbornly to a creed when there is no intellectual support is to run the risk of "growing in ignorance. Yet unless we have the courage to put doubts behind us and believe in certain things that have not been and may never be proved, we cannot get along in the world we live in. It just won't hold together.

Consider this, for the moment, on the personal level. Suppose you have a friend who has a reputation for being a liar. People will say, "If you believe what that character says, you'll lose your shirt."

ACCEPTING THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE 185

What do you do? Do you say to yourself, "All right, until he's proved himself to be honest, I'll be careful"'? That would be the normal reaction, but it wouldn't help to remedy the situation at all. Your being suspicious is not going to make an honest person of your friend or anybody else.

But suppose you say, "'Okay, maybe there's a certain amount of danger, but I like him and I'm going to trust him." You would be surprised at the effect. There is every chance that your friend will be honest with you whether he lies to other people or not.  It is very difficult for most people to betray someone who they know trusts them. This is the power of faith: it brings out the good in people. To put it another way, you can evoke the buddha nature in another person by paying reverence to it.

If we all trusted each other, wouldn't this be : wonderful world to live in? Mutual confidence would be a great pipeline serving to bring us all together and prevent us from injuring one another.  We could help each other and thereby find greater happiness for ourselves and others.

We do not come into the world doubting. In early childhood everybody has absolute confidence in his parents. Unfortunately, when children begin to grow up, sooner or later they have the experience of being betrayed not once but many times. Inevi tably they go through phase in which they are convinced that nobody is to be believed. "I'll never trust anybody again as long as I live" are words that everybody has uttered at one time or another. There's nothing exceptional about it.

Human beings are not perfect. Whether on purpose, or of necessity, or unwittingly, we all betray other people from time to time. It is hardly surprising that by the time young people are grown many of them consider it the mark of wisdom to be skep tical. This attitude may indeed be prevalent among adults today.  But is it really foolish or childish to trust people? Is it clever always to be in doubt? If one takes a narrow view and thinks only of immediate gains and losses, perhaps it is. But I look at it differently. If you are conferring with someone or making a request of him, the whole drift of the conversation is governed by whether that person trusts you or not. People sense other people's feelings and change what they say to suit the circumstances. Doubt cannot really be concealed. And doubt gives rise to distrust, which creates resistance and may lead to out-and-out conflict.  This is the reason for a great deal of the unhappiness that all of us suffer as we go through life.

186 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT

We need to stop and think. It is impossible for one person to be happy all the time and everybody else miserable. By the same token it is impossible for everybody else to be happy all the time and one personyou alonemiserable. The only way for a human being to be truly happy is for him to be happy together with others. In the very short run, it may be folly to place one's trust in people, but the greater wisdom enjoins us to believe.  This is the meaning of the Japanese saying that "the sage resembles the fool." The trust we need more of today is the lofty mutual trust of mature people building a happy human environment together. How can we create that trust ? The key is to live in accordance with the principles of the universeto live in such a way as to bring out the buddha-nature that resides in all things and all beings.


Some of the confusion and difficulty we experience in the world today seems to me to arise from a mistaken view of democracy.  Many people appear to have the notion that democracy means equality for all in every respect; they are not happy unless men are the same as women, students the same as teachers, parents the same as children. On the face of it, this is ridiculous--men can't have babies; students can't teach school; children can't provide for parents; nobody wants to give the vote to infants.  Yet our failure to work out standards that would be fair to all leaves everybody with the suspicion that he is being imposed upon that he is not as equal as he ought to be.

Not long ago dropped a small bomb at my house. I have three children in school, and as rule am the last to leave in the morning, but on this particular day I had to be at the university early. As I was going out, I waited for a moment at the front door, but nobody came to see me off. My children were all watching television.

ACCEPTING THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE 187

Outraged at this breach of Japanese etiquette, I shouted, "Hey, what kind of a dump is this? Doesn't anybody believe in giving the breadwinner around here a sendoff?"

"Just a moment !" came the reply as all three of them scrambled out to the front hall. "Goodbye, Daddy, have a nice day.' It would all have been very touching if I hadn't had to ask for it.  What, I wondered, is the world coming to?

But when I sounded off about this to one of the younger professors, he merely sighed and said, *I envy you, sir. At least your children do what they're supposed to do after you remind them. When I tell mine they ought to do this or that, they don't say, 'Yes, father.' They say, 'Yeah, I know.' But then they don't do what told them to. If they know, the way they say, then that must mean they're deliberately paying no attention to me. But then nobody seems to expect children to listen to their parents any more. We live in evil times.'

If you ask a young person why he ignores his parents, he will answer something like this: "Oh, what they say is so old fashioned you'd think they were a hundred years old. It just doesn't make sense in this day and age. How can we be expected to understand a lot of old-fogy ideas?"

The words might be different, but the gist would be that young people can't understand why their parents think as they do. This, I believe, brings us back to what I was saying before: this is the reaction of young people brought up in an age of doubt, an age of science. But the truth is that nobody can really understand what someone else is saying unless he has a similar de gree of experience, knowledge, and judgment. For children not to understand their parents is nothing brought on by the spread of scientific knowledge. What we owe to science is the notion that children need not learn what they don't understand.

In order to understand parent, you must be a parent, just as you must be fifty years old to understand people that age. Once you are fifty and a parent, you are in a position to understand what your mother and father were saying forty years ago, but by that time it's too late.

188 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT

As human beings, we will not really be able to understand the teachings of Shakyamuni until we have arrived at the same sphere of enlightenment as he. But to do that we must die and be reborn in the cycle of reincarnation hundreds and thousands of times. If we pay no attention to the Buddha until after we've done that, it will be too late. That is why we have faith: it enables us to be live without fully understanding.

Our parents and our ancestors are to us as guides who have preceded us along the way. Unless we recognize their authority and respect them, there is no way of transmitting or preserving the culture to which we belong. This remains true in the most democratic of ages.

The young may counter that parents make mistakes too. Was it not, after all, their parents' generation that started the Second World War?

This argument is not without reason. If the young believe everything they are told, they stand to be deceived in the worst way. There is never even any guarantee that one's own father is right. How to overcome this drawback is one of life's great difficulties. Still, if there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, even mistakes and blunders can furnish food for thought, which might lead to the discovery of new values.

To trust one's parents or one's elders is not, after all, to swal low everything they say whole. In this respect, we can derive a lesson or two from some of the many anecdotes that are told concerning the eccentric Zen priest Ikkya (1394-1481).


It is said that when Ikkyu was five, he was sent to a temple called the Ankoku-ji as an acolyte. As he grew, he proved himself to have a great deal of native intelligence and wit.  He was one of seven acolytes at the temple. One day when they were all talking together, one of them remarked on how the temple priest had taken to staying up late at night. *There's something funny going on, he commented. "Nobody likes to sleep better than he, but the past few nights he's been sitting up by the lamp till all hours."

ACCEPTING THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE 189

The next night, after everybody else had gone to bed, Ikkya stealthily took up watch outside the priest's room. After a time, the priest went to the closet and from its depths removed a jar of rock candy. Plopping piece into his mouth, he sat for a time sucking contentedly.

1kkya knocked on the door and entered. Feigning surprise, he said, "Why, Master, whatever is in that jar? It looks just like rock candy."* Whereupon the priest gulped down the sweet in his mouth, tucked the jar into the folds of his robe, and replied with an air of shocked innocence, "Candy, child? What could you be thinking? This is medicine. At my age, the cold makes my legs and back ache so that I have to take something to relieve the pain. This is a palsy remedy. It's so strong that one taste of it would kill boy your age."

"Oh, I see," replied Ikkya sweetly, "It's medicine for you, but poison for children. In that case, I suppose I'd better not ask you to give me a piece. Good night, Master, sleep well,"

After the boy left, the priest smiled to himself. "Never doubted it for a moment, he thought. But a surprise was in store for him. The next morning, he went to the nearby village on a little business, and when he returned, all the acolytes were in his room weeping and wailing.

"What's going on?" he cried. "Why are you all here? What's all this weeping?"

Voice quaking with sobs, Ikkyu answered, "Please forgive us, Master. We were cleaning your room and one of us dropped that ink box of yours the one you treasure more than life itself.  It's broken beyond repair, We decided that we would have to commit suicide to atone for the loss, so we took all that medicine you said would poison children. We're waiting now for death to come. And Ikkya fell to crying again.

The priest, caught in the act of eating his rock candy, had committed two sins: he had given in to his own selfishness, and he had lied, Ikkya had outdone him by demonstrating two immu table truths: that all things are impermanent (the ink box) and that he who is born must die (the "suicide").

190 THE BUDDHA IN THE ROBOT

Deeds like this earned Ikkyu such a reputation for sagacity that the great shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) expressed a desire to meet him. When Ikkyu, accompanied by the priest, arrived at the shogun's palace, Yoshimitsu said, **I heard that you are a very clever boy, and thought perhaps you would do me a favor. See that screen painting there? Well, at night the tiger in it sneaks out into the town and attacks innocent people. This has caused : great deal of trouble, and I would like to get you to tie up the tiger for me.'

Yoshimitsu could not suppress a grin as he made the absurd request. The priest and all the others thought the shogun had outwitted Ikkya, but Ikkya showed no signs of distress. He simply sat for a time staring thoughtfully at the painting,

At length he said, "All right, I'll do it. Please have someone bring me a rope.

The rope was brought and placed by Ikkya's side. Taking one end in hand, he stood up, took a stance, and shouted, "Quick, now! Somebody chase the tiger out into the middle of the room.  I'm waiting.'

Instead of complaining to the shogun that what he was asking was unreasonable, Ikkyu accepted the challenge at face value and threw it right back, Yoshimitsu was forced to admit defeat, but he still had another trick up his sleeve.

Showing Ikkyu to a different room, he ordered the servants to place dinner before him. When the meal appeared, it consisted of a number of dishes that priests are forbidden to eat -- a broiled sea bream, sashimi, and several other delicacies made from the flesh of living creatures. Yoshimitsu waited gleefully to see how Ikkya would react.

But Ikkya's only reaction was to dig right in and start eating with gusto.

"What's this, Ikkya?" asked the shogun. "You're a priest, yet you're eating fish?"

Ikkyu swallowed what he was chewing, then replied nonchalantly, "It's only passing through-my stomach is a thoroughfare."

Genuine devotion to the Buddha consists not in fasting but in seeing life within the flow of existence and in finding truth within change. All things are constantly moving and shifting. No matter what it is -- money, possessions, knowledge, information -- if you attempt to take it in and stop it from moving, you will be out of harmony with the universe. By following the natural flow of things, you can be guided by that greater harmonysuch is the truth implicit in Ikkya's statement about his stomach being only a thoroughfare.

Had Ikkya allowed himself to become indignant or angry, as young people today might do when they think they're being taken lightly by their elders, he would not have been able to respond with such ingenuity. He would not, in fact, have perceived the truth concealed within the situations confronting him.

A passage in the Much Mondo (Conversations in a Dream) by the early fourteenth-century Zen Buddhist Mus0 Kokushi, says, "Teachers, being human, make mistakes, but that is no reason to deny everything they say or to forget how to learn from them."  The same is true of parents.

In this volume, which might have been entitled The Parable of the Robot, I have tried to discuss various truths and principles of Buddhism in terms that make sense to young people living in a scientific age. I would be the first to agree that what I have written does not go beyond the limits of intellectual comprehension. It does not attempt to explain faith, which involves not only rea soning but also a deep personal conviction. The second-century Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna wrote, "In the great sea of the Buddha's Law, faith is the means of entry, and wisdom is the means of salvation. Today, we might say that science offers doubts and proofs, while faith makes it possible to live a good life.

If we only doubt and never believe, we injure others and eventually destroy ourselves. I firmly believe that if we are to realize the full potentialities that exist in this world, we must be able not only to doubt and prove but also to act courageously on faith when the occasion demands.
