#### meta crisis

- more integrated frameworks for solution creation

- emergence, topics, attractors

- "emergence by design"
  facilitate emergence?
  
- climate change
- AI
  GPT-3
  autonomous drone
  synthetic bio

- many catastrophic risks as a result of industrialization
  cumulative externalities
  decentralized terrorism
  tabletop CRISPR

- information is the input for all the catastrophic risks
  open society?

(oops - "tragedy of the commons" reference)

underlying patterns of human collective coordination and action failures

- pervasive incentives + game theory

- avoid dystopian solutions

decentralized systems with checks and balances and avoid corruption?

self-induced existential risk???

- creation of a third attractor?

=============================
Tomas Bjorkman
 - thinking, being, doing
 
emergence - cannot be managed?
 - how can it be facilitated?

DS: complicated vs complex vs chaotic systems?
 - shadow side of emergence: lack of rigor and responsibility to think
   well

Homo habilus - tool-making the biggest change similar to the current
 situation

Evolution is no longer the driving force for humans in the world since
 tool making and improvement

Can humans make it through Fermi's Gate?

TB: Enlightenment, Axial Age?

DS: tech that confers power becomes obligate
 - near-term game theoretic advantage has been the winning behavior
   - it is self-terminating
 - psycho-social causation?
 
 triage: nearest term risks need to avoid by any means to buy time
  - climate refugees, slow down AI and bio
 transition: work with existing institutions (captialism, nation
 states, etc.) and orient them better
 post-transition: new infrastructures, social structures, superstructures
 
Anastasia Uglova:
 - connect diagnosis to solutions
 - thoughts on institutional inertia
 
DS: make sure the problem is well understood is primary
 - leave with questions
 - need to create bespoke solutions; they will be everchanging

Joe Lightfoot:
 - need to emphasize our cooperative nature?

DS: cannot focus on cooperation and coordination; easy to over simplify
 - cannot avoid competition with existing external forces
 - cannot avoid our individual competitive tendencies or it becomes a
   shadow
   - competition can yield improved capacities

David Storey:
 - how to improve education and infuse thinking in younger students

DS: consilience papers
 - MIT publications
 - purpose of education
 - psycho-social health of a society?

### my report:
i watched the entire hour; made some notes. one thing i appreciate is
Daniel's insistence that whatever new systems we construct or invent
or discover cannot avoid our own shadows and tendencies toward
corruption. this fits with our own little convo about our own
individual and shared public, private, and secret lives, mysteries,
prayers, and magic.
