 - Some random musing: the intro
 
 > Reflecting on my Congressional Representative (Roger Williams, TX, Republican) and his steady stream of emails critical of any and all governmental programs that support what citizens need: clean air and water, health care, child support, public safety and education, and a robust effort to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases.

 - The aversion to big government has roots in the European rejection
   of 17th and 18th century social and political power
   arrangements. The power was held by land owners, monarchs, and
   religious institutions.

 - The long nineteenth century transferred social and political power
   to naton-states, merchants, and financiers. Land ownership and
   religious credibility remained important factors in supporting
   social structures that inherited and maintained hierarchical
   relationships among men and women, rich and poor, European and
   other.
