My free-associative notes:

/ ecosystems versus systems - the jargon and the general //

/ "public facing edge" - great notion; maybe edges and surfaces? //

/ graphs and pipelines - are they always a pair, or two-of-a-kind? //

> ... public sites and selected content from private Libraries are networked together on the [[Fediverse]] using the [[ActivityPub standard]], creating a personalised, decentralised Social Knowledge Graph of both [[Followers]] and [[Friends]].
  
/ love that sentence; do i know what it means? //

> Your Hub brings together everything you Like (the stuff you’d recommend your friends and followers should read), everything you Think (your own blogposts and other articles, wherever they’re published) and everything you Do (your personal portfolio). Everything is tagged, and the natural language search interface makes it easy to create Collections

   export it as Markdown and maybe make something of it in an Obsidian
