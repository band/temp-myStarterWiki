# 2022-06-16 David Wengrow and Amitav Ghosh in conversation


DW: current grand narratives we have now are sterile
 - sterile and grand at the same time
 - story of how we got here -- no future
 
 - seedbeds, paths not taken, seeds of other ways of thinking
 
AG: as a writer: well-written, droll
 - such a bore when reading much academic writing

DW: being kind to the reader (DG)
 - politics of vitality (difference)
 - overlap: limitations of text
   analogy with scripture (text)
   limitation of writing to express oral phenomenom

AG: the edges of the textual
 - [The Fallling Sky]
 - Deloria ?
 - how enlightenment ideas arise in conflict with indigenous thought
 - Native American culture seeded ideas of freedom
 
 - how dreams, imagings, visions ???
 
DW: different cosmological views
 - questions about different genres on styles of knowledge
 - both books consider the dehumanization of large parts of humanity
 - reason, logic, and humor

AG: the great divergence argument
 - maybe the Chinese decided industrialization was not a good idea
 
DW:  move away, disobey, change the world

AG: enmeshment of fossil fuels and colonial forms of power (mutual
 enhancing)
 - without conceiving vitalism we are stuck with what we can think of
   doing
 - [Three Songs for Benizir?]
 
DW: is a policy of vitalism possible or adaptable now?

AG: vitalism on non-human entities; non-human entities do not leave
   written records
 - storytelling needs to reclaim the voices of the non-human
 - economists, archeologists, historians have no ways to include the
   non-human
   
DW: vitalist principles do not always lead to positive outcomes
 (Aztecs)
 - where is the social ecology movement in the Nutmeg's Curse?
   Murray Bookchin

AG: my book is about literary solutions; storytelling
 - how to put narratives together
 - vitalist politics? 
 - occupy protests are vitalist
 
DW: overlap of sacredness and property in both books
 - homology between ownership and rituals of the sacred

AG: what did Euros learn from their ability of kill so many people?

DW: anthropocene the latest in the stage-theory of history

AG: imaginative leap - to intellligence of plants
 - new stories giving stories to the non-human
 
IBIS Trilogy?
