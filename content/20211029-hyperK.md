# 2021-10-29   Hyperknowledge call

1. would be good to watch the first lecture

2. overall goal of HK
   - create a model of ideas
	 data and visual
   - use model to create a collective 
   
3. the local model

HK data bus

events are immutable
concepts are fluid

meta-model
reference model

lingua franca between systems

(cf. Marshall & Shipman - premature formalizatoin)

topic maps: legends (like legends on maps?)
conceptual graphs - Sowa?
  - subgraphs
reason in counter-factuals
speak about claims w/o asserting or negating

roles (from topic mapping) versus slots

(cf. Bill Kent - the many forms of a simple fact)

semiotic triangle (Pierce)
interpretation relation

concept == equivalence class of symbols
concept proxy (materialized concept)

what is a representation?

frames - minimal representation language for hyperknowledge
frames and entities

propositional concept and truth value
distinction - the other side of equivalence
abstration == the erasure of specified distinctions

representation == most unique name of a concept

situated symbols (yes!)

adding predicates


( Cliffords, ethics of belief )

definitional versus empirical
