insight as active energy
Bohm
group dialogue
the intention to explore thought
any object of thought is both more than what we think and different
propositional
a propositional map
it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems is the source of our problems
fragmentation
thought is very active
thought is always doing a great deal
thinking with computers
thought has the character that it is doing something and saying it isn't doing it
thought is not different from emotion
the wish to think
thinking/thought
the thought
thought then acts automatically
feeling/felt
feeling/felts
felts
felt
feelings which have been recorded
the past
the present/the past
the way thought has developed
collective efforts to fashion a tolerable civilization

the flow of meaning between people
the flow of meaning
the collective movement of values, meanings, and intentions
an unbroken field of mutually informing thought
thought's activity
constructing a reflex
the whole state of the body
the state of the body
incoherence
incoherences
"Yes that's incoherent. Let me try to find out the wrong information and then change it."
thought doesn't know
thought doesn't know when it is doing something and then it struggles against what it is doing
paying attention to thought
thoughts are always incomplete
sustained incoherence
simple incoherence
the things that matter
conscious intentions
conscious intent
destructive
a waste of energy
conflict
why do we have this incoherence?
this incoherence
kinds of incoherence
thinking into thought
thought is an active set of movements
systems
system
thought system
a process of thinking
I thought that before
clarity of thought
our thoughts
thoughts as habits
thoughts as reflexes
thought is in chaos
the chaos of thought
mistakes thought makes
changing the information
changing the thought
I don't know what's wrong
taking the surface and calling it reality
we have that feeling
what seems to be
what seems to be/what is
what is
I can't change the information
we all want to do things and we can't do what we want
book: The Fifth Discipline
very often there are problems because people are not following the effects of their thoughts
they treat it as an independent problem
their way of thinking is causing a problem
thought is active
thought is active and participating
why does it take over?
can thought be aware of itself?
self-perception of thought
the process of thought
structure in thought
features in the system which become fixed
certain features in the system which become fixed
system of thought
systemic fault
a systemic fault
we may not want to know
perception that goes beyond memory
a memory of intuition
intuition
anything repeated
anything repeated several times becomes part of the system
thought
thought can produce experiences without our being aware that they are produced by thought
learning to question the question
the question
look at the question
what are we going to do with it?
a whole system
a pervasive systemic flaw
the incoherence
seeing what it means for yourself
seeing for yourself
one system
you have to see it as one system
if it is one system you deal with all the parts

a kind of addiction in the thought process
the thought process
the thought process is neurophysiological as well as intellectual and emotional
neurophysiological process
intellectual process
emotional process
negative thinking/positive thinking
memory
thoughts registered in memory
addicted to false thoughts
people often find it easier to accept guilt
image/reality
image/reflex
understanding the whole thing
understanding the whole thing in one piece
the positive and the negative are two sides of one system
let's try to look at that
pleasure directly implies pain, and pain implies pleasure
pleasure is always a transitory phenomenon
coherent thought
if thought can be determined by pleasure or pain, that's already the beginning of a lot of trouble
we get conditioned by that
the attempt to control endorphins is not coherent
destructive consequences
awakening
a level which is not controlled by the system
do we have the potential for more than the content of the system?
thought as a set of reflexes
thought as a set of conditioned reflexes
the conditioning of reflexes
frequent repetition
the basic form of conditioning is to repeat something quite often
establishing conditioned reflexes
a great deal of our routing learning consists in establishing conditioned reflexes
conditioned reflexes can affect the feelings
a chain of thought
a series of reflexes
a reflex
if somebody asks you your name you have an immediate answer
a searching reflex
thought is a very subtle set of reflexes which is potentially unlimited
anything percieved becomes sooner or later a set of reflexes
a set of reflexes
growing thought
growing thought/growing reflexes
thinking as growing thought
appropriate reflexes
there may be a perception of reason beyond the reflexes
a perception of reason beyond the reflexes
perception of reason
anything percieved becomes a set of reflexes
the reflex system
thought as a reflex system
a reflex system
can you become aware of the reflex quality of thought?
as long as the reflexes can be changed, the must be something a bit beyond the reflexes
the reflexes
the reflex
strong conditioning
every thought involves some change in the chemistry of the system
the evolution of learning
the evolution of thought
the possibilities of directed evolution
directed evolution
thinking and thought
conditioning by reflex
conditioning the reflex
conditioning reflex
conditioning reflexes
if something changes and the reflex doesn't, you have incoherence
sensitivity to incoherence
are you getting results you don't want?
you have to be sensitive to incoherence
the test for incoherence
the test for incoherence is whether you're getting the results you don't want
violence: the undue use of force
a kind of incoherence
the problems arise in thought
the problems are in thought
these problems are in thought
violence will never solve the problem in thought
there are all sorts of ways to produce endorphins
coherence in truth
a limited coherence
what are the values in thinking?
what are the values involved in thinking?
things you don't want
what you don't want
engaging in learning
how are we going to change the reflexes?
we need to go deeper somehow
we need to go deeper
an understanding so deep that is does touch the reflexes
Ok, it didn't work. Why not?
not paying attention
paying attention
paying attention to a higher level of understanding
paying attention to a higher level of effectiveness
paying attention to a higher level of order
paying attention to a higher level of insight
paying attention to a higher level of inquiry
paying attention to a higher level of motive
paying attention to a higher level of value
paying attention to a higher level of design
here's an incoherence
here is an incoherence
pay attention
to point to another level
attention
attention is a potential
attention is a potential to take us deeper
the kind of attention that will take us deeper
the intellect has to be clear
a map which is misleading
seeing deeper

to try to change
what is necessity and what is contingency
our idea of reality
what is necessary
what is always necessary
impelled: being pushed from within
impelled
repelled
compelled
propelled
distinguish
distinguish: to mark apart
distinction
distinction/division
clear thinking
to be coherent
we have to move towards coherence
our creative technology challenges us
it requires sustained work
I've changed
saying I've changed
you could just look at it
if you don't get it into words, it's not likely you are going to see it
whenever
the assumption of necessity
learning more about the whole system
maybe we can learn something which can then be extended
selective reflexes
you can watch what the words do to your chemistry
something happens to thought when we express it
perception of thought
synapse connections
the nerves in the brain don't quite touch each other
when the reflex gets very strong and rigid
a defensive reflex

defensive incoherence
coherent
are these reflexes coherent?
now the question is: are these reflexes coherent?
an intelligent response
our particular structure

thought always provides limits which have limited validity
an incoherent procedure
knowing is a system which is based on the unknown
"knowing is a system which is based on the unknown"
"every idea is a representation--an abstraction which leaves out most of the reality"
being
a correspondence between one abstraction and another
for truth to arise there must be a certain situation in the brain
"for truth to arise there must be a certain situation in the brain"

a kind of perception
the subject/the object
the fantasy

the fantasy of loss
the fantasy of fear
to make sense of it
to make it coherent
it sets up a reflex
to get free of being bound to this image
the image/the object
the image/the subject
a reflexive act
we need to look into this
it disorganizes the system
the whole system
it involves the whole system
it seems that I am looking at myself
we try to arrange thoughts that way
why do people do this?
you can see that there is a process going on which involves the whole system
you are this
you are that
a sense of identity
a sense of identity built up out of thought
several images at once
what they can do
you can put your identity into almost anything
do we need an identity?
the system gives you the identity
your place in the world
the whole system of thought
I am unknown
what I am is unknown, but constantly revealing itself
I am somehow grounded in that
the notion of an identity
a certain chemistry
an insight into the whole
fixedness

the fixedness of the ideas
the fixedness of the chemistry/the fixedness of the ideas
the system as a whole
an identified being
the question of identity
part of the image
the notion of a creative being
the notion of a creative being, rather than of an identified being
the point is to have the notion of a creative being, rather than of an identified being
the attempt to hold this identity
my thought
make it explicit and at least you can see what thought is doing
perception of thinking
say the words
say the thought
each thought is incomplete
the words which express the way you are actually thinking
finding the right words
finding the right words for thoughts
a block to the creative energy
having an identity
a strong addiction
it can behave like a machine
it can behave something like a machine
the self as observer
the self as observed
the perception of that
the perception of that separation
this notion of identity
the whole totality of whatever is
our ground
our material ground
the material structures that we are
a permanent identity
our thoughts about it
empty space is full of energy
the Planck length
whatever is behind the mind
the consciousness
the fullness of space
the ground of all existence
the forms in thought
the forms in thought by which we try to represent matter
correct representations
forms in thought by which we try to represent matter
correct thought
if there is correct thought
the ground of the thing
material structure
in the material structure
that which we call energy one one side is mind on the other side
that's the suggestion
deeper perceptions
deeper perceptions of truth
we have all sorts of representations of ourselves which are really rather superficial
once we do that
this quality of thought
this quality of thought which infuses it into perception
we apparently perceive this thing we are representing
it seems to be there
what we actually have is a whole lot of thoughts going on in consciousness
projecting a self
we have a representation of the self
we have a representation of the self, which is really arising in a process
whatever you mean as yourself
the essence of the essence
quintessence
the essence of the whole thing
the thing itself
the very essence of it
your essence
your very essence
representations which we are liable to mistake for actuality
whatever the self is, its essence is unknown but constantly revealing itself
the thought that we are something limited and known
one point to clear up
we cannot be that which is limited and known
nothing can be what is limited and known; that can an best be an abstraction or a representation
the sense of identification of self
all the memory
there is always the unknown
we are not going to exhaust the unknown
the almost infinite energy in empty space
a vast unknown
it is revealing itself
the unknown ground of all that is
a creative notion of being
limited and repetitive
we don't know
it sort of blocks things
this is the unknown revealing itself
eternal flux
a similar form
in our thought
representing in our thought
representing those forms in our thought
representing forms in our thought
representing forms
even the basic actuality of memory is the unknown
everything we know is a form
everything we know is a form, which we sort of project onto the background of consciousness
it can be projected correctly or incorrectly
we have to ask how coherent it is
individually/collectively
done individually/done collectively
projecting forms
it may not be what we think it is
the forms of representations
ultimons
if you assume
you have no way of knowing
how do you know that?
as far as I can see
as far as I can see, that's the way it is
a very serious mistake
part of the flaw
part of the flaw in the system
the flaw in the system
trying to get hold of it
something beyond knowledge
knowledge cannot be complete
maybe it would be possible
maybe it would be possible, and maybe not
that what is beyond
the way we picture it
knowledge/knowing
sensitivity in knowing
knowing is a process based on the unknown
the word creating the sensation
something which is there as a possibility
I have no interest in that
whether we do it or don't
perception of truth
various kinds of thought
looking at thoughts
looking at thoughts which are getting in the way
looking at thoughts which are getting in the way of this
part of our culture
thoughts which are part of our culture
some insight into this
the old way
the chemistry
the point I would like to make
a lot of confusion
a lot of confusion around that
true ideas
every idea is a representation
every idea is a representation--an abstraction which leaves out most of the reality
there is a correspondence between one abstraction and another
a correspondence of form
whatever you mean by yourself
representations which are liable to be mistaken for actuality
whatever the self is
if you are learning
the idea of an identity of being
a notion of identity
how do you know that's what you are?
representing these forms
sharing our thought and consciousness
alethia
for truth to arise
a state of the material system
beyond what thought can grasp
truth is a key factor in what is
truth is a key factor in actuality
inappropriate abstraction
there seems to be something more
the creative imagination
shared meaning
part of the culture
to see the whole of it
to see the essential features of it
dialogue
in the dialogue
a oneness
a cultural situation
a shared meaning
ethnic subcultures
religious subcultures
economic subcultures
that kind of difficulty
the concept of dialogue
those who are dominant
an emotional charge
different assumptions
two different assumptions
a different assumption
opposing assumptions
opposing opinions
assumptions of necessity
his assumptions of necessity
assumptions from the culture
culture/cultivate
meanings of what is necessary
you have to work together
people resisting one another
there is a resistance
contrary intentions
contrary reflexes
you have to stay with this
you have to stay with this conflict
how thought is producing conflict
staying with this
a set of intentions
a common assumption
a necessity
a necessity/an intention
the meaning of what's going on
talking about dialogue
the meaning of this situation
the meaning of this situation collectively
something means a lot to me
creating a significance
I mean to do it
something with great significance
to articulate that significance
communicating that significance
a common necessity
the meaning of the situation
the idea of meaning
what is necessary/what is valuable
what is worthwhile
the perception of the meaning
they don't see the meaning of that
what things mean to you
what things mean to you will determine the way you act
our thinking goes into the perception and gives it a different meaning
a given number of facts
we should get together and talk
many different meanings
many different meanings could come out of that
thoughts/meanings
vast numbers of thoughts
seeing the meaning differently
seeing the meaning
why we can't get together
they might together for this reason
people are trying to get together
people are trying to get together for countless reasons
the ecological crisis
they all have different meanings
they all have different meanings as to what should be done
they can fight each other
they can fight each other and cancel each other out
they can fight each other and cancel out each other's efforts
they are trying to get together
seeing the point
seeing the point of what is going on
seeing how thought works
they are not able to
this deeper question of meaning
everybody has a different meaning
a particular meaning
whatever the meaning is
how we perceive reality
the world situation
a personal direction
a subjective direction
that's where we have to start
making it necessary
making it necessary to do it
to have a reason
to have a reason for a group of people to come together
to attempt to have a dialogue
a dialogue
to have a dialogue
the work needed to make it happen
if we are going to sustain the work needed to make it happen
to sustain the dialogue
to sustain the dialogue week after week
these resistances
there are all these resistances
there are all these resistances that are going to come up
a firm perception
a firm perception the meaning of dialogue
the meaning of dialogue
the meaning of the whole situation
why are we here?
some vague sense
some vague sense of it
not yet formulated
that's one of the difficulties we have to get through
a creative step
we need a creative step
if you have an insight into it
why don't people see this clearly?
a very present danger
it seems people can't see it
this thought process
this thought process which is collective as well as individual
the collective fantasies
myths are collective fantasies
it seems a very present danger
it seems a very present danger and yet people can't see it
as if they were perceived realities
a somewhat different way
we are not seeing the direct fact
this is the fact from which we must start
our individual conditioning
our cultural conditioning
our individual cultural conditioning
the field of the system of thought
the same flaw
it makes dialogue necessary
the value of dialogue
we see the value of dialogue
to generate some sort of purpose
the perception can get deeper and deeper
let's sustain the dialogue
what the situation means to us
if we see the necessity of it
the necessity of it
it is a necessity
that purpose may change
that purpose may change again and again
contrary assumptions
the situation is a necessity
it's not necessary at all
a certain way of thought
people try to get hold of this
these assumptions are stopping us
these assumptions are stopping us from communicating
this emotional charge
evidence that they are wrong
an ordinary group
we don't want to put limits on human possibilities
it doesn't look likely
I'm saying it doesn't look likely
if they were very creative
if they were very creative and stuck with it
if they learn how to share meaning
if they learn how to share meaning together
scientists of group process
coming to see
coming to show
coming to show people
the necessity of sharing meaning
there's also another possibility
if they are sufficiently open
if they are sufficiently open they may see a common necessity
the typical people in our society
necessity is a significance
the situation signifies necessity
how do you know that something is necessary?
a significance
how do you know what is necessary?
significances
there's a possibility that we could see this common meaning
this common meaning
a common meaning
I'm communicating a significance
I might not be able to articulate that significance
communicating this significance
seeing where we can go
the chances are they would not
by a creative step
we may all see a common meaning
as you see the meaning
as you see the meaning more deeply
as you see the meaning more deeply you may have to shift the purpose
it is very hard to see the meaning of this
in the reflexes
the reflex comes up
it's a kind of meaning
a particular kind of meaning
these is a necessity
the necessity of dialogue
that is not a common perception
a situation where that is not a common perception
I'm starting from a situation where that is not a common perception
what I'm questioning
that's what I'm questioning
the way that the world is
if you don't understand what it means
most people don't see it
they don't see it right away
they don't see the meaning of that right away
you don't see the fact clearly unless you see a coherent meaning
the highest form of civilization
people are seeing the meaning differently
not seeing the point
not seeing the point of what's going on
it has moved
the meaning
the meaning of the fact
the true fact
where we have to start
whether we will do it or not
whether we will do it or not remains to be seen
the significance of dialogue
to sustain the work needed to make it happen
resistances
resistances that are going to come up
the meaning of the whole
the thoughts
the fantasies
every culture has its myths
that is the fact
to deconstruct our culture
to deconstruct our individual conditioning
to deconstruct our individual conditioning as we go along
to deconstruct our culture as we go along
the individual system of thought
the collective system of thought
that system of thought
trying to get into it
to see that it calls for something
to see that it makes something necessary
some immediate purpose
an insight
an insight into the necessity
really communicating
these assumptions give this emotional charge
the necessity of seeing all of that
I'm saying that it doesn't look likely
a group has to share meaning
the biggest obstacle
to learn how to share meaning together
the necessity of sharing meaning together
the biggest obstacle to a group achieving whatever is was formed to do is that is has to share meaning
that's what I'm saying
what we have to watch
what we have to watch is how we move away
if we are really serious
if we are really serious about it
I really see the necessity
I really see the necessity and I won't stop because I failed at that point
I'll stick with it
I'll stick with it and see if I can't find why it's not working
play with it
you can play with this
very serious assumptions
very serious assumptions will come up which are very, very, powerful
you'll stick with it
you'll stick with it even though it gets difficult
you'll stick with it even though it gets difficult and unpleasant
you'll stick with it even though it gets unpleasant
we can't guarantee that this is going to work
if you ask for a guarantee beforehand you might never do it
on a level we have no idea about
working on a level we have no idea about
working differently on a level we have no idea about
we don't know too well what it means
a vision of dialogue
what it might mean
you don't have to accept it
it may be a way to look at it
you don't have to accept it, but it may be a way to look at it
it may be that when you first try this it won't work
it's an important vision
almost anything worthwhile doesn't work the first time you try it
almost anything worthwhile doesn't work when you first try it
suppose we can stick with this
let's suppose we can stick with this
we face this emotional charge
all this irritation
all this smog
all this frustration
very powerful assumptions
if very powerful assumptions are there
some assumptions
what is really possible
we could say that
suppose you stick with this
a shared insight
you may get a shared insight
you may get an insight
we're all in the same position
everybody has an assumption
everybody is sticking with his assumption
everybody is disturbed neurochemically
a neurophysiological chemical disturbance
a neurophysiological chemical disturbance of a very powerful kind
the fundamental level
the superficial differences
the superficial differences are not so important
an inference
if you actually get an insight
the whole reflex
at that moment
the whole reflex structure
a level of contact
it might be touched
the thought process is an extension of the body process
all the body language
all the body language is showing it
close contact
when people are in really close contact
something which is very important to them
talking about something which is very important to them
their hearts
their adrenalin
all the neurochemicals
closer contact
far closer contact
the same basis
the same content
all the opinions
all the assumptions
the difference is secondary
at that moment the difference is secondary
there is no conflict
there is no conflict in the fact that the individual does not agree
it's not all that important whether you agree or not
there is no pressure to agree or disagree
there's contact
there doesn't need to be an agreement
we have to listen to every thought and see its meaning
we don't have to agree that somebody is right
we don't have to agree that somebody is right, but we have to listen to every thought and see its meaning
it is at another level
a socially acceptable reason
if I look beyond the assumptions
we can see that we all have these assumptions
I'm not deciding they are right and wrong
I'm looking at the meaning of what you say
the vision of dialogue
sharing a common meaning
another assumption
we all listen to that
this kind of bond
impersonal fellowship
you don't have to know each other
their ordinary personal relations
in war
that close connection
that connection
connection
that fellowship

it doesn't really work
is there any way out?
